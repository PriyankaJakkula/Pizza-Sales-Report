# Pizza-Sales-Report
I‚Äôve just completed a Power BI dashboard that dives deep into pizza sales data! üçïüìà This project was a great opportunity to integrate my SQL skills with advanced data visualization techniques.
I created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze pizza sales data.
-Using SQL to query the raw data
-Writing SQL queries to calculate KPIs (key performance indicators) like total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold
-Creating additional SQL queries to analyze sales trends, sales by category and size, and identify top and bottom selling pizzas
-Importing the data into Power BI and cleaning it using Power Query
-Building visualizations in Power BI to explore the data, including KPI gauges, charts to show daily and monthly trends, and breakdowns of sales by category and size
-Creating a separate dashboard to identify the worst and best-selling pizzas
-Adding navigator buttons to allow users to easily interact with the dashboards
This Power BI dashboard would be a valuable tool for a pizzeria owner or manager to gain valuable insights into their sales data, such as:
Overall sales performance
Sales trends over time
Which pizza categories and sizes are the most popular
Profitability of different pizzas.
